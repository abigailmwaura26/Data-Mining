        "  \n",
        "    **- BINARY** (Classification): Potentially FraudFound_P, which is either 0 or 1. We could predict whether certain input parameters make it more or less likely that a claim is fraudulent.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **- CATEGORICAL** (Classification): Potentially PastNumberOfClaims, which has 10 levels. We could predict how many claims a driver with certain parameters is likely to make.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **- NUMERIC** (Regression): We could predict the VehiclePrice, which, when paired with the BasePolicy, could determine the insurance payout if car is  total loss.\n",
        "2. **QUESTIONS TO ASK**: Which input attributes are relevant to our target variable? Which input attributes are not relevant?\n",
        "3. **ANY PROBLEMATIC DATA?**: Yes; DayOfWeekClaimed and MonthClaimed have 8 and 13 levels when they should have 7 and 12. To determine what to do, we will check how many datapoints these are; if not too many, their (non)existence will not affect the final outcome, and we can discard. If more than 5%, we will keep and substitute an appropriate value.\n",
        "4. **ANY INCONSISTENT DATA?**: Yes. The Age Variable contains a group of 0 (zero) values that either need to be cleaned up or the rows discarded. To determine what to do, we will check how many datapoints these are; if not too many, their (non)existence will not affect the final outcome, and we can discard. If more than 5%, we will keep and substitute an appropriate value based on a related measure, AgeOfPolicyHolder.\n",
        "5. **ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR SIMPLIFYING?**: Yes. AgeOfVehicle should really be numeric and can be easily transformed.\n",
        "6. **ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDUCING THE DATAFRAME FOR EASE OF PROCESSING IN A NEURAL NETWORK?**: Yes. We know that multiple layers are very computation-heavy, so smaller datasets process more easily. We will evaluate whether we need all the attributes to predict the chosen target variable."

        "To level the playing field and ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, we normalize them. Normalization scales all features to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1 or with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This way, each feature's contribution is balanced, and the neural network can learn more effectively from all the data.\n",

Another way is to use the [**preprocessing.Normalization layer**](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/numerical/normalization/). This layer is a clean and simple way to build that preprocessing into your model. And YES--by creating the normalization layer, you effectively just started building your TensorFlow model:"
